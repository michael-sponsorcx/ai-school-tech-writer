4. Commit Message:

5. Updated README Content:
   - The provided README content seems to be unrelated to the code changes and commit messages. It talks about a Technical Writer Agent project and guidelines for customization.

Based on the code changes, it seems that the README file might need an update to reflect the changes in the DBT models and SQL script. The updated README should include details about the new models, columns, tests, and relationships added in the `dbt/_mart__models.yml` file.

Additionally, the YAML file content should be updated based on the new DBT tests that could be added to the modified DBT files.

If you need further assistance or clarification on how to update the README file and YAML content, feel free to ask!
